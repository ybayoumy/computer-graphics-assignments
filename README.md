## Ray Tracing Demo

This is a CPU implementation of ray tracing that demonstrates the use of Reflections and Shadow Rays.

There are 2 Scene in this demo. The program automatically starts on Scene 1.

### Scene 1
<img src="images/Scene1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

### Scene 2
<img src="images/Scene2.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

### Controls

- Press `1` to switch to Scene 1
- Press `2` to switch to Scene 2

**Note:** It takes some time to load the scenes
